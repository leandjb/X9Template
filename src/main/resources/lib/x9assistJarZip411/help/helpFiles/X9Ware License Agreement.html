Confidential Information shall include any written reports, findings, conclusions, recommendations, or reporting data and analysis prepared by Disclosing Party and provided to Receiving Party under this Agreement, or information that due to its nature or the circumstances of its disclosure, a person exercising reasonable business judgment would understand to be confidential or proprietary of a party.</p><p class="P8">(ii) Exceptions to Nondisclosure.

Receiving Party agrees to use the same degree of care that it uses to protect its own confidential information of a similar nature and value, but in no event less than a reasonable standard of care, to ensure that Confidential Information are not disclosed or distributed by its Representatives in violation of the provisions of this Agreement. Such care shall include, but not be limited to, Receiving Party’s maintenance of appropriate administrative, technical and procedural safeguards to: (i) ensure the security and confidentiality of Confidential Information, (ii) protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of Confidential Information, and (iii) protect against unauthorized access to or use of Confidential Information which could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to Disclosing Party.

Receiving Party shall at any time upon the Disclosing Party’s written request either return or destroy, at the Disclosing Party’s option, the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Receiving Party may keep a copy of Confidential Information solely for maintaining reasonably appropriate business records or as may be required by law. Confidential Information shall be subject to these provisions for five (5) years after termination of the Agreement.</p><p class="P8">(vii) Unauthorized Access or Use. Receiving Party shall: 1) promptly notify Disclosing Party of any material unauthorized possession, use or knowledge, or attempt thereof, of Confidential Information by any person or entity which may become known to it; 2) promptly furnish to Disclosing Party full details of the unauthorized possession, use or knowledge, or attempt thereof, and assist Disclosing Party in investigating or preventing the recurrence of any unauthorized possession, use or knowledge, or attempt thereof, of Confidential Information; 3) cooperate with Disclosing Party in any litigation and investigation against third parties deemed necessary by the other party to protect its proprietary rights; 4) promptly use its best efforts to prevent a recurrence of any such unauthorized possession, use or knowledge, or attempt thereof, of Confidential Information; and 5) bear the cost it incurs as a result of compliance with this section.</p><p class="P8"> </p><p class="P7">5.
