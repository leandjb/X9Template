/**
 * X9UtilImagePullMonitor directs image pull activities against a series of image pull entry maps,
 * which in aggregate represent the images to be pulled. The exact number of started threads is
 * dependent on the number of available processors and system property settings. Performance is
 * maximized by splitting input across internally created lists which are then processed
 * independently by concurrent threads. Statistics are accumulated within each worker task and
 * aggregated and reported on completion.
