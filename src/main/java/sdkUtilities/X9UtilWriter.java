/**
 * X9UtilWriter is part of our utilities package which builds an x9 output file on a field by field
 * basis from a user provided csv file. Our design is twofold. First is to simplify this process as
 * much as possible (eg, we will automatically create the headers and trailers, and we also control
 * all of the bundling). Second is to provide as much flexibility as possible (eg, by still
 * providing the ability to support both ICL and ICLR and to optionally create addendum records).
 * The image records (type 50 and 52) are easily created using an image record that explicitly
 * defines the fully qualified file name for the front and back image. These images files can be
 * TIFF (where they must be a compliant x9.100-187 tiff image and will be written exactly as
 * provided) or can be some other image format (PNG, JPG, BMP, or GIF) and will be converted to an
 * x9 compliant tiff. X9UtilWriter faithfully creates the output file using the fields as provided
 * on the user input csv file. We very purposefully do not validate those fields for content. We do
 * incorporate all logic needed to justify and pad fields appropriately, and will truncate to the
 * maximum field length if the data length is excessive. But we otherwise always attempt to pass the
 * data through exactly as present from the csv file. This is the same result if the user was using
 * our SDK to directly create the x9 file. In that situation, it would be their requirement to
 * ensure that appropriate field values are being populated. You should use X9Assist during your
 * initial testing process to ensure that you are setting appropriate field values and that your
 * images are fully compliant.
